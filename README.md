# hackathon-website

⚠️ (VERY EARLY) WORK IN PROGRESS ⚠️

We are building a website for a possible OSC hackathon.

A place for sponsors, attendees, etc. to find information that wont clutter up our main site.

Right now, we have a NextJS static site that basically says "check back soon". 

I don't know who's getting involved so I havent had a chance to discuss a tech stack, but we'll probably roll with React.
